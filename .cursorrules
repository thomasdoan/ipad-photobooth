# FotoX Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is an iPad photobooth app built with Swift/SwiftUI that communicates with a Raspberry Pi backend.

## Code Style

### Swift
- Use Swift 5.9+ features
- Prefer `async/await` over completion handlers
- Use `@Observable` for view models (iOS 17+)
- Mark types as `Sendable` when needed for concurrency
- Use `@MainActor` for UI-related code

### SwiftUI
- Use `@State` for local view state
- Use `@Environment` for shared state
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep views small and focused

### Naming
- Views: `FeatureNameView.swift`
- ViewModels: `FeatureNameViewModel.swift`
- Use camelCase for properties, PascalCase for types
- Prefix private properties with context when needed

## Architecture

### State Management
- Central `AppState` holds navigation and shared state
- ViewModels hold screen-specific state
- Services handle API calls and business logic

### Navigation
- Enum-based routing via `AppRoute`
- Change `appState.currentRoute` to navigate
- No UIKit navigation controllers

### Dependency Injection
- Services passed through `ServiceContainer`
- `TestableServiceContainer` for mock injection
- No singletons for testability

## File Organization
```
Core/           - Shared code (models, networking, services)
Features/       - Screen-specific code (view + viewmodel pairs)
App/            - App-level state and configuration
```

## Testing
- Unit tests in `fotoXTests/` using Swift Testing framework
- UI tests in `fotoXUITests/` using XCUITest
- Use `--use-mock-data` flag for deterministic UI tests
- Test JSON parsing for all API models

## API Integration
- Base URL: `http://booth.local/api` (configurable)
- All endpoints defined in `Endpoints.swift`
- Use `APIClient` for all HTTP requests
- Handle errors with `APIError` enum

## Common Tasks

### Adding a Feature
1. Create View and ViewModel in `Features/`
2. Add route to `AppRouter.swift`
3. Handle route in `RootView` switch statement
4. Wire up services via `ServiceContainer`

### Adding an API Call
1. Define endpoint in `Endpoints.swift`
2. Add service method (e.g., in `SessionService`)
3. Add mock in `TestableServiceContainer`
4. Add unit test for response parsing

### Debugging
- Use `print()` for quick debugging (shows in Xcode console)
- Use View Debugger for layout issues
- Camera only works on physical device

## Don'ts
- Don't use `any` type if avoidable
- Don't use force unwrap (`!`) except for known-safe cases
- Don't create new singletons
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't hardcode URLs or secrets
